cocoonjs-jquery
===============

Implementation of jQuery subset for running in CocoonJS Javascript runtime.

This project is on a very initial stage. Implemented subset is very small. It even has no unit tests yet.

On the other hand this subset is used in HTML5 game engine for quests. So if your codebase depends on jQuery and you are not planing to stop using its very essential features then you can use this project as a point to start.

Project license allows to do anything with it, but don't forget to contribute back.

Happy coding!
